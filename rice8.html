        <p> I am genuinely ok. I think that is the first time in a long time that a I have said that and actually meant it. <br>
            I am very confused about my life, the world, and where I sit within all of that, but that is never ending... <br>
            I don't think I will ever know who I am. I don't know if I'll ever understand. But I am becoming more ok with that. <br>
           Am I working on myself, or just forgetting the past mes? Am I a good person or will I ever be? <br> 
           Is what I do enough to counter the endless devastating events happening around me. <br>
           Those are just a few of the mind numbing questions that I think about when doing any minor task even if it's just brushing my teeth. <br>
           I don't know if I am improving as a person if everything I learn requires me to forget something else. I feel like a big ball of rage.<br>
           So with that do I even have a right to be happy? Should I smile at my phone every time one person texts me, <br>
           or should I be focussed on my career and improving the planet and can those be mutually productive? <br>
           So basically ok pretty much sums it up for the current moment. But I will never -not- be confused.</p>
